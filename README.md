Dataset: Emergency Department Visits and Admissions for Influenza-like Illness and/or Pneumonia
	I have chosen the dataset provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene found in the NYC OpenData website. The data provided by this dataset displays the drastic increase in emergency care due to Influenza-like illness and/or pneumonia, which was not categorized as, but likely caused by the Covid-19 virus. My interest was if Covid-19 still exists as a looming threat, or has become a stable seasonal illness and will slowly fade to become the “new” seasonal flu. The dataset is found at the NYC OpenData, and it is data that was updated daily, automatically and was created April 28, 2020, updates ceased with the last import of data happening December 5, 2022, with earliest data from March 1, 2020, according to the NYC OpenData User guide . The data is based on the daily changes in the Count of all emergency department visits, Count of influenza-like illness and/or pneumonia visits, Count of influenza-like illness and/or pneumonia visits admitted to the hospital. These visits are categorized using the Modified ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTA) of patient residence, in order to track spread of the virus via patient residence. 
Qualitative data column: mod_zcta.
Quantitative data columns: Count of all emergency department visits, Count of all emergency department visits
