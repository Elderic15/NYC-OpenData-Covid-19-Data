Dataset: COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths
	I have chosen the dataset provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene found in the NYC OpenData website. Covid-19 has been influential in our lives since the pandemic, recently it has been a much less impactfully sickness, but it still affects many and seemingly comes back in the colder flu seasons. My question is whether the Covid-19 virus has become akin to the seasonal flu, or if it still should create the same sense of fear it did in early 2020. The dataset is found at the NYC OpenData, and it is data that is updated daily, automatically and was created April 30, 2020, with earliest data from february 29, 2020, according to the NYC OpenData COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths User Guide. The data is based on the daily changes in a long list of categories, the most notable being case count, death count, hospitalized count and probable death count. There are also subsets of the case counts based on the region the positive test is found. The regions listed are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. Also included are 7 day averages of most data collected.
